# dashboard
In this project I learned to use modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a fully responsive admin dashboard with light and dark mode theme functionality. Here I also use CSS Variables, CSS Boxes, CSS Flexbox, Media queries for our responsive design, and CSS transitions and animations for some cool animation effects.
